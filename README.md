FHAndroidTemplate
=================

A native Android Template for the FeedHenry platform

A native template for rapid development using the FeedHenry platform. The template uses standard Android boilerplate code to utilize UI elements like the Navigation Drawer, the Action Bar and Fragments.

The FeedHenry SDK is integrated and used to perform cloud calls, store data in the cloud using Mongo DB and performs an example using a third party API to get location based weather data. Push notifications will be in a later release.

Supports Android 4+ (API 14)
